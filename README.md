## pr-tree-viewer
The PR's 'Changed Files' show the contents of the changed files only in the form of a list, so it's difficult to understand the overall structure.<br>
This extension provides the ability to view changed files in a tree structure, opens and closes all of the files to help you check them more conveniently.
